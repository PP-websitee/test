            <h2>Extended Essay</h2>
            <p>The Extended Essay is a core component of the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme. It is an independent, self-directed piece of research, culminating in a 4,000-word paper. The process of writing the Extended Essay is intended to provide students with the opportunity to engage in independent research and writing skills expected at university level.
            <br>
                <br>
            Students are expected to choose a topic of interest within one of the six DP subjects they are studying. They will need to develop a clear and precise research question, and their approach should be analytical and critical. They will need to demonstrate skills in research, organization, evaluation of sources, and they must construct a reasoned argument.
                <br>
                <br>
            The Extended Essay process helps students develop skills in formulating an appropriate research question, engaging in a personal exploration of the topic, communicating ideas, and developing an argument. It provides practical preparation for undergraduate research and an opportunity for students to engage in an in-depth study of a topic of interest within a chosen subject.
<br>
                <br>
            Students in the MYP are required to become active learners, well-rounded individuals and engaged world citizens. The programme empowers students to inquire into a wide range of issues and ideas of significance locally, nationally and globally. The result is young people who are creative, critical and reflective thinkers.
            <br>
                <br>
In terms of skills, MYP students need to develop strong communication skills, both in their mother tongue and in at least one other language. They should become critical and reflective thinkers, able to analyze and evaluate issues and ideas. Research skills are also crucial, as MYP students are encouraged to become self-directed learners who recognize and explore the nature of knowledge. Finally, MYP students need to develop an understanding of their own identities, and open-mindedness towards the perspectives and values of others.
